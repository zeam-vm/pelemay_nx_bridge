defmodule PelemayNxBridge do
  @moduledoc """
  `PelemayNxBridge` is an experimental code that will provide `PelemayNxBridge.Enum` 
  compatible with `Elixir.Enum`. 
  It uses Nx as the underlying data structure and redefines Elixir's general-purpose 
  list, map, and other data structures. 
  In the future, we plan to incorporate it into Elixir and Erlang, 
  and develop it so that it will be accelerated and parallelized by BeamAsm.
