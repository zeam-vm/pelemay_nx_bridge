# PelemayNxBridge

PelemayNxBridge is an experimental code that will provide PelemayNxBridge.Enum compatible with Elixir.Enum. It uses Nx as the underlying data structure and redefines Elixir's general-purpose list, map, and other data structures. In the future, we plan to incorporate it into Elixir and Erlang, and develop it so that it will be accelerated and parallelized by BeamAsm.
